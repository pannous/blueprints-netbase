Welcome to [**Netbase**](https://github.com/pannous/netbase/) 
 a high-performance semantic graph database, optimized for natural language queries on static freebase data.

[**blueprints**](https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints) is a graph database standard allowing for toolchaining, making databases available to all different tools.

Libraries and binaries are included for Mac and Linux.

You can feed it with any CSV XML or N3 data.
Optimized for the quick import of Wordnet, DBPEDIA and Freebase (and 
[private data](https://github.com/pannous/lang) )

Thanks to shared memory and binary dumps you can load and process billions of nodes+statements(edges) and hundreds of gigabytes in no time.

Requirements: 
* Lots of RAM favorable
* For java-binding / blueprints : no requirements
* For server : data favorable
* For command line access: 'readline' lib :

	sudo port install readline
	sudo yum install readline
	sudo apt-get install readline

Playing with it:

`./bin/netbase`
